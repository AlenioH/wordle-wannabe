# Wordle Wannabe App ðŸŽ¯

This app is a lightweight take on the Wordle game, built using **React**. It challenges players to guess a word while getting feedback on which letters are in the correct position or present elsewhere in the word.

### Features:
- **Random Word Generation**: Words are fetched dynamically using the [Random Words API](http://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home).
- **Word Validation**: Ensures your guesses are real words using the [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/).
- **Interactive UI**: Responsive design and visually appealing feedback for correct and partially correct guesses.
- **Accessible**: Designed to be easy to play and navigate.
- **Custom Styles**: Styled using CSS for a clean and functional look.
